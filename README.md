# Training a Pendulum with Q Learning

This project is a simple example of training a pendulum to balance using Q learning. The pendulum is a simple inverted pendulum system with a single joint and a mass at the end. The pendulum is trained using a Q learning algorithm to balance the pendulum in the upright position.
