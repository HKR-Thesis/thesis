# Inverted Pendulum Robot Simulator

A versatile inverted pendulum simulation for educational and research purposes. This simulation provides a platform for experimenting with control systems, machine learning, and parameter tuning.

## Overview & Usage

The Inverted Pendulum Simulation is designed to serve as a tool for understanding and experimenting with the dynamics of an inverted pendulum system. It can be used for a wide range of educational and research purposes, including:

- Implementing and testing control algorithms (e.g., PID, LQR).
- Training machine learning models for control.
- Exploring the effects of parameter tuning.
- Studying the behavior of physical systems.
